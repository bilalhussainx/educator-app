She uses the phrases `Maybe` and `we can` to express the possibility of this happening.\n\n`Maybe` is a word used when you are suggesting a possibility, but you are not sure if this possibility will happen or not. It shows that you are not making a definite plan, but you are open to the idea. For example: if someone asks you if you want to go to the movies, you can say `Maybe` if you are not sure if you want to go or if you are available.\n\n`We can` is used to suggest an idea or propose something in a polite way. It shows that the people in the conversation have the ability or the option to do something. For example, if you want to suggest playing a game, you can say `We can play a game` to offer the idea.\n\nThe difference between `maybe` and `we can` is that `maybe` suggests a possibility without making a definite plan, while `we can` suggests an idea or proposal in a polite way.",

Like this:\n\n| Affirmative | Interrogative |\n| --- | --- |\n| `You are a developer.` | `Are you a developer?` |\n\nChanging the order of the noun and the verb doesn't work in every situation. Most sentences need you to add an auxiliary verb to create questions. One of the most common auxiliary verbs is `do`.\n\nYou can use the verb `do` as an auxiliary to most verbs. In the present tense it assumes the form of `do` (I, you, we, they) and `does` (he, she, it). It is like a marker you will add to the beginning of your sentence and lets everyone know that sentence is a question. For example:\n\n| Affirmative | Interrogative |\n| --- | --- |\n| `You debug on Fridays.` | `Do you debug on Fridays?` |",

Another example could be a question like, `What else is he working with?` where `with` at the end asks about other tools or technologies being used.",

In this case, you can add the words `light` (tending to `white`) and `dark` (tending to `black`) before the color to express it. Another characteristic that you normally use to identify another person's eyes is the shape - `round` when it is more like a circle and `narrow` when it is more similar to a line. Finally, you can refer to them in terms of their size, `large` (when they are big) or `small` (when they are not). Tom also expresses an opinion, saying Lisa's eyes are full of energy and vitality. In this case, you say one's eyes is `bright`.\n\nAs you do with `hair`, the adjectives to identify a person's eyes also follow an order in English.

When referring to another person, use `What does he/she do?` or `What do they do?` (more general and avoids determining a gender to the other person) to know about another person's job and `What is he/she doing?` or `What are they doing?` to know about another person's activity at the moment.",

Example: `he does not wear glasses`.\n\nOne typical characteristic used to describe a person is to mention that they normally have or don't have their glasses on.\n\nListen to Sophie's description of Tom and fill in the blanks.",

For example, you can make a `timeline` of your day, starting with the moment when you wake up and ending with the moment when you go to sleep. It helps you see what happens first, next, and last. In projects, it is important to have a `timeline` to understand when and in what sequence certain tasks happen.\n\n`To match` means that one piece of information is the same as another piece of information. If two things `don't match`, they are not the same. For example, if your friend's name is spelled differently on two lists, his name on the first list `doesn't match` his name on the second. It means they are different from each other.\n\nThe `documentation` of a project is a collection of papers or files that give important information about it. It includes details like what the project is about, the steps to complete it, and any rules or guidelines to follow. It helps everyone involved in the project understand what to do and how to do it.",

For example, if a bag of apples weighs `2 pounds` (for those who use the metric system, approximately 1 `kilogram`), it means the apples are as heavy as that.\n\n`Chicken wings` are a type of food made from the wings of a chicken. They are often cooked and eaten as a snack or meal, sometimes with sauce or seasoning.\n\n`To agree on something` means that two or more people share the same opinion or decision about a specific thing. For example, if you and your friend both decide to go to the movies, you can say `I agree on going to the movies` to tell your friend you like the plan or idea.",

On the other hand, `ethically` is an adverb that describes how something is done in a moral or fair way, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.\n \nIn English, both adjectives and adverbs are used to provide more information about verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs in a sentence. However, they serve different roles:\n \n`Adjectives` are words that describe or modify nouns (people, places, things, or ideas). They provide more information about the noun, giving details such as size, color, shape, or emotion. For example, in the phrase `a green apple`, the word `green` is an adjective because it describes the noun \"apple.\"\n \n`Adverbs`, on the other hand, are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They provide information about how an action is done, when it happened, where it happened, or to what extent. Adverbs often end in `-ly`, but not always. For example, in the phrase `She sings elegantly`, the word `elegantly` is an adverb because it describes how the action of singing is done.\n \nRead the sentence and fill in the blanks with the correct term: `ethical` or `ethically`.",

They ask questions and try to find answers.\n\n`Research` means trying to find more information about something. You might do research by reading books, looking online, or testing to learn new things. When you talk about `scientific research`, it normally involves a more formal setting, with regulated conditions.\n\nThe word `also` can be used in substitution to `too` and can be added in different places in a sentence. Examples: `He can play the guitar, but he plays the piano, too.` (`too` is normally added in the end of the sentence, preceded by a comma). `He can play the guitar, but he can also play the piano` (you can add `also` before the verb and in the middle of the sentence).

This is similar to other words starting with `every-` like `everything` and `everybody`.\n\nFor example, you say `Everyone goes to the party`, `Everything is right` or `Everybody works hard`.\n\n`Make sure` means to check or ensure something is correct before moving on. For example, `You make sure the code runs` means you check the code to be certain it has no errors and can run properly.\n\n`Follow the rules` means to do what the rules say. If there is a rule that says `use camelCase for variable names`, to `follow the rules` means you name your variables like `myVariable` instead of `myBLANKvariable`.",

For example:\n\nInstead of saying `It seems like you have a lot of energy this morning`, you could say `You look energetic this morning`. Here, the adjective `energetic` is more concise and expressive, showing that someone has a lot of energy in a positive way.",

      "description": "The words you use in a sentence can make a big difference in modulating the message it delivers. \nLet's look at some examples to understand this better.\n\nPrepositions like `by` affect the verb that comes after. When you use `by`, it often needs the verb to end with `-ing`. Here's an example:\n\n`I improved by practicing daily` (This means I got better at something because I practiced every day. You use the preposition `by` to show how something is done)\n\nAdjectives can also change the meaning of the following word by adding details to them. The word `light` can serve as an adjective to describe something not heavy or not intense. For example:\n\n`Light exercises are good for beginners.` This means exercises that are not heavy or hard are good for people who are just starting. The word `light` as an adjective tells you what kind of exercises they are.\n\nEven words like `family` and `outdoor` can be used as adjectives, they describe the noun that follows them. For example:\n\n* `Family activities bring everyone together.` (`family` describes the type of activities)\n* `Outdoor sports are enjoyable in good weather.` (`outdoor` describes where the sports happen)",

This approach allows the team to adapt to changes quickly, make improvements along the way, and work closely with stakeholders for continuous improvement at every stage.\n\nFor example, `Using agile methodology, we can adjust the project quickly based on feedback.`\n\nThe phrase `way to go` means a good or correct choice or decision.

Now that she knows he does, she asks `How long have you been into photography?` to know the amount of time that has passed since he started enjoying it. \n\nSince the question is about duration from the past up until the present, you use the *Present Perfect* tense. \n\nAlso, remember that the form of the verb `to be` for the Present Perfect is `been`. For example: `I have been in a traffic jam for an hour. I can't wait to go home.`\n\nWhen you want to ask questions related to duration, start the question with `How long`. Examples: `How long is this movie?`, `How long have you two been married?`\n\nFill in the blanks with the appropriate words.",

For example, if you say, `Let's discuss our plans for the weekend`, you are suggesting having a conversation about what each of you would like to do on the weekend.\n\nThe word `upcoming` is an adjective used to describe something that will happen soon. An example is `We have an upcoming meeting on Monday.` This means that there is a meeting scheduled to happen on Monday.\n\nThe verb `think` means considering something, to form opinions, or to imagine. For instance, `I need to think about your question before I answer.` It indicates you want to take some time to consider or reflect on the question to give a thoughtful response.",

This tense is often used with expressions of time such as `for` and `since`. `For` is used with a period of time like two years or six months, while `since` is used with a specific point in time, like 2018 or this morning.\n\nExamples:\n\n`I have been studying English for two years.` This means I started studying English two years ago and I'm still studying it now.\n\n`She has been working here since 2018.` It means she started working here in 2018 and is still working here.\n\nListen to Brian and fill in the blanks.",

This information can be numbers, text, or other types of data. You can change what's in the box, which is why it's called a `variable` – because it can vary. For example, in `x = 5`, `x` temporarily holds the value 5.\n\nA `data type` is a classification that specifies the type of data that a `variable` can hold. Common `data types` include integers (whole numbers), floats (numbers with a decimal), strings (text), and booleans (true or false). For example, if `age = 21`, the `data type` is an integer.\n\nA `conditional statement` is a command that tells the computer to do something only if a specific condition is true. It's like making a decision in real life based on a certain situation. Common `conditional statements` are `if-else` statements. For example, `if (temperature > 20) {console.log(\"It's warm outside!\");}` is a `conditional statement` that executes `console.log(\"It's warm outside!\")` if the temperature is above 20 degrees.",

This class defines the structure of objects, including their attributes and methods. For instance, a `Car` class might include attributes like `color` and `model`, and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`.\n\nThe term `oriented` in this context means aligned or directed towards a particular purpose or principle.\n\nFor example, freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum is described as `project-oriented` because it is structured around completing projects, which means the teaching method is focused on practical application rather than just theoretical knowledge.",

They do not invert the subject and the verb and often begin with phrases like `I was wondering` or `Could you tell me`.

      "description": "In this task, you'll explore the metaphorical use of terms to understand programming concepts. Metaphors are a powerful way to visualize and explain complex ideas by relating them to everyday objects or actions.\n\n`Container` is used metaphorically to describe variables as things that can hold and store different data, much like how a `container` can hold different items.\n\nThe actions `fill and empty` describe how you can add or remove data from variables, similar to how you might `fill` a water bottle or pour the water out.\n\n`Locked boxes` describes constants as secure, unchangeable `containers`, emphasizing they can't be changed once set.\n\nThe phrase `keep the same contents` highlights that the data in constants does not change, like a box that is locked and always holds the same things inside.",
