But D3 needs more information about the position and size of each `circle` to display them correctly.\n\nA `circle` in SVG has three main attributes. The `cx` and `cy` attributes are the coordinates. They tell D3 where to position the _center_ of the shape on the SVG. The radius (`r` attribute) gives the size of the `circle`.\n\nJust like the `rect` `y` coordinate, the `cy` attribute for a `circle` is measured from the top of the SVG, not from the bottom.\n\nAll three attributes can use a callback function to set their values dynamically. Remember that all methods chained after `data(dataset)` run once per item in `dataset`. The `d` parameter in the callback function refers to the current item in `dataset`, which is an array for each point. You use bracket notation, like `d[0]`, to access the values in that array.",

      "dashedName": "add-axes-to-a-visualization",
      "description": "Another way to improve the scatter plot is to add an x-axis and a y-axis.\n\nD3 has two methods, `axisLeft()` and `axisBottom()`, to render the y-axis and x-axis, respectively. Here's an example to create the x-axis based on the `xScale` in the previous challenges:\n\n```js\nconst xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale);\n```\n\nThe next step is to render the axis on the SVG. To do so, you can use a general SVG component, the `g` element. The `g` stands for group. Unlike `rect`, `circle`, and `text`, an axis is just a straight line when it's rendered. Because it is a simple shape, using `g` works. The last step is to apply a `transform` attribute to position the axis on the SVG in the right place. Otherwise, the line would render along the border of the SVG and wouldn't be visible. SVG supports different types of `transforms`, but positioning an axis needs `translate`. When it's applied to the `g` element, it moves the whole group over and down by the given amounts. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nconst xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale);\n\nsvg\n  .append('g')\n  .attr('transform', 'translate(0, ' + (h - padding) + ')')\n  .call(xAxis);\n```\n\nThe above code places the x-axis at the bottom of the SVG. Then it's passed as an argument to the `call()` method. The y-axis works in the same way, except the `translate` argument is in the form `(x, 0)`. Because `translate` is a string in the `attr()` method above, you can use concatenation to include variable values for its arguments.",
      "instructions": "The scatter plot now has an x-axis. Create a y-axis in a variable named `yAxis` using the `axisLeft()` method. Then render the axis using a `g` element. Make sure to use a `transform` attribute to translate the axis by the amount of padding units right, and `0` units down. Remember to `call()` the axis.",

      "description": "Using a lot of inline styles on HTML elements gets hard to manage, even for smaller apps. It's easier to add a class to elements and style that class one time using CSS rules. D3 has the `attr()` method to add any HTML attribute to an element, including a class name.\n\nThe `attr()` method works the same way that `style()` does. It takes comma-separated values, and can use a callback function. Here's an example to add a class of `container` to a selection:\n\n```js\nselection.attr('class', 'container');\n```\n\nNote that the `class` parameter will remain the same whenever you need to add a class and only the `container` parameter will change.",

It takes an argument for the name of the element you want and returns an HTML node for the first element in the document that matches the name. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nconst anchor = d3.select('a');\n```\n\nThe above example finds the first anchor tag on the page and saves an HTML node for it in the variable `anchor`. You can use the selection with other methods. The `d3` part of the example is a reference to the D3 object, which is how you access D3 methods.\n\nTwo other useful methods are `append()` and `text()`.\n\nThe `append()` method takes an argument for the element you want to add to the document. It appends an HTML node to a selected item, and returns a handle to that node.\n\nThe `text()` method either sets the text of the selected node, or gets the current text. To set the value, you pass a string as an argument inside the parentheses of the method.\n\nHere's an example that selects an unordered list, appends a list item, and adds text:\n\n```js\nd3.select('ul')?.append('li').text('Very important item');\n```\n\nD3 allows you to chain several methods together with periods to perform a number of actions in a row.",

You can use a callback function in the `style()` method and include the conditional logic. The callback function uses the `d` parameter to represent the data point:\n\n```js\nselection.style('color', d => {});\n```\n\nThe `style()` method is not limited to setting the `color` - it can be used with other CSS properties as well.",

      "description": "The bar and scatter plot charts both plotted data directly onto the SVG. However, if the height of a bar or one of the data points were larger than the SVG height or width values, it would go outside the SVG area.\n\nIn D3, there are scales to help plot data. `scales` are functions that tell the program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG.\n\nFor example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG and you want to plot Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be in the billion or trillion-dollar range. You provide D3 a type of scale to tell it how to place the large GDP values into that 100x500-sized area.\n\nIt's unlikely you would plot raw data as-is. Before plotting it, you set the scale for your entire data set, so that the `x` and `y` values fit your SVG width and height.\n\nD3 has several scale types. For a linear scale (usually used with quantitative data), there is the D3 method `scaleLinear()`:\n\n```js\nconst scale = d3.scaleLinear();\n```\n\nBy default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is the same as the value of the output. A separate challenge covers how to change this.",

They are used to display data. For example, a rectangle (`<rect>`) SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.\n\nWhen you place a shape into the `svg` area, you can specify where it goes with `x` and `y` coordinates. The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. Positive values for `x` push the shape to the right, and positive values for `y` push the shape down from the origin point.\n\nTo place a shape in the middle of the 500 (width) x 100 (height) `svg` from last challenge, the `x` coordinate would be 250 and the `y` coordinate would be 50.\n\nAn SVG `rect` has four attributes.

      "description": "The last challenge created and appended a rectangle to the `svg` element for each point in `dataset` to represent a bar. Unfortunately, they were all stacked on top of each other.\n\nThe placement of a rectangle is handled by the `x` and `y` attributes. They tell D3 where to start drawing the shape in the `svg` area. The last challenge set them each to 0, so every bar was placed in the upper-left corner.\n\nFor a bar chart, all of the bars should sit on the same vertical level, which means the `y` value stays the same (at 0) for all bars. The `x` value, however, needs to change as you add new bars. Remember that larger `x` values push items farther to the right. As you go through the array elements in `dataset`, the `x` value should increase.\n\nThe `attr()` method in D3 accepts a callback function to dynamically set that attribute. The callback function takes two arguments, one for the data point itself (usually `d`) and one for the index of the data point in the array. The second argument for the index is optional. Here's the format:\n\n```js\nselection.attr('property', (d, i) => {});\n```\n\nIt's important to note that you do NOT need to write a `for` loop or use `forEach()` to iterate over the items in the data set. Recall that the `data()` method parses the data set, and any method that's chained after `data()` is run once for each item in the data set.",
      "instructions": "Change the `x` attribute callback function so it returns the index times 30.\n\n**Note:** Each bar has a width of 25, so increasing each `x` value by 30 adds some space between the bars. Any value greater than 25 would work in this example.",

      "description": "You may have noticed the bar chart looked like it's upside-down, or inverted. This is because of how SVG uses (x, y) coordinates.\n\nIn SVG, the origin point for the coordinates is in the upper-left corner. An `x` coordinate of 0 places a shape on the left edge of the SVG area. A `y` coordinate of 0 places a shape on the top edge of the SVG area. Higher `x` values push the rectangle to the right. Higher `y` values push the rectangle down.\n\nTo make the bars right-side-up, you need to change the way the `y` coordinate is calculated. It needs to account for both the height of the bar and the total height of the SVG area.\n\nThe height of the SVG area is 100. If you have a data point of 0 in the set, you would want the bar to start at the bottom of the SVG area (not the top). To do this, the `y` coordinate needs a value of 100. If the data point value were 1, you would start with a `y` coordinate of 100 to set the bar at the bottom. Then you need to account for the height of the bar of 1, so the final `y` coordinate would be 99.\n\nThe `y` coordinate that is `y = heightOfSVG - heightOfBar` would place the bars right-side-up.",
      "instructions": "Change the callback function for the `y` attribute to set the bars right-side-up. Remember that the `height` of the bar is 3 times the data value `d`.\n\n**Note:** In general, the relationship is `y = h - m * d`, where `m` is the constant that scales the data points.",

However, scales can be much more flexible and interesting.\n\nSay a dataset has values ranging from 50 to 480. This is the input information for a scale, also known as the <dfn>domain</dfn>.\n\nYou want to map those points along the `x` axis on the SVG, between 10 units and 500 units. This is the output information, also known as the <dfn>range</dfn>.\n\nThe `domain()` and `range()` methods set these values for the scale. Both methods take an array of at least two elements as an argument. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nscale.domain([50, 480]);\nscale.range([10, 500]);\nscale(50);\nscale(480);\nscale(325);\nscale(750);\nd3.scaleLinear();\n```\n\nIn order, the following values would be displayed in the console: `10`, `500`, `323.37`, and `807.67`.\n\nNotice that the scale uses the linear relationship between the domain and range values to figure out what the output should be for a given number. The minimum value in the domain (50) maps to the minimum value (10) in the range.",
      "instructions": "Create a scale and set its domain to `[250, 500]` and range to `[10, 150]`.\n\n**Note:** You can chain the `domain()` and `range()` methods onto the `scale` variable.",

      "description": "The D3 `min()` and `max()` methods are useful to help set the scale.\n\nGiven a complex data set, one priority is to set the scale so the visualization fits the SVG container's width and height. You want all the data plotted inside the SVG so it's visible on the web page.\n\nThe example below sets the x-axis scale for scatter plot data. The `domain()` method passes information to the scale about the raw data values for the plot. The `range()` method gives it information about the actual space on the web page for the visualization.\n\nIn the example, the domain goes from 0 to the maximum in the set. It uses the `max()` method with a callback function based on the x values in the arrays. The range uses the SVG's width (`w`), but it includes some padding, too. This puts space between the scatter plot dots and the edge of the SVG.\n\n```js\nconst dataset = [\n  [34, 78],\n  [109, 280],\n  [310, 120],\n  [79, 411],\n  [420, 220],\n  [233, 145],\n  [333, 96],\n  [222, 333],\n  [78, 320],\n  [21, 123]\n];\nconst w = 500;\nconst h = 500;\n\nconst padding = 30;\nconst xScale = d3\n  .scaleLinear()\n  .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, d => d[0])])\n  .range([padding, w - padding]);\n```\n\nThe padding may be confusing at first. Picture the x-axis as a horizontal line from 0 to 500 (the width value for the SVG). Including the padding in the `range()` method forces the plot to start at 30 along that line (instead of 0), and end at 470 (instead of 500).",
      "instructions": "Use the `yScale` variable to create a linear y-axis scale. The domain should start at zero and go to the maximum `y` value in the set. The range should use the SVG height (`h`) and include padding.\n\n**Note:** Remember to keep the plot right-side-up. When you set the range for the y coordinates, the higher value (height minus padding) is the first argument, and the lower value is the second argument.",

      "description": "The D3 methods `domain()` and `range()` set that information for your scale based on the data. There are a couple methods to make that easier.\n\nOften when you set the domain, you'll want to use the minimum and maximum values within the data set. Trying to find these values manually, especially in a large data set, may cause errors.\n\nD3 has two methods - `min()` and `max()` to return this information. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nconst exampleData = [34, 234, 73, 90, 6, 52];\nd3.min(exampleData);\nd3.max(exampleData);\n```\n\nA dataset may have nested arrays, like the `[x, y]` coordinate pairs that were in the scatter plot example. In that case, you need to tell D3 how to calculate the maximum and minimum. Fortunately, both the `min()` and `max()` methods take a callback function. In this example, the callback function's argument `d` is for the current inner array. The callback needs to return the element from the inner array (the `x` or `y` value) over which you want to compute the maximum or minimum. Here's an example for how to find the min and max values with an array of arrays:\n\n```js\nconst locationData = [\n  [1, 7],\n  [6, 3],\n  [8, 3]\n];\nconst minX = d3.min(locationData, d => d[0]);\n```\n\n`minX` would have the value `1`.",

      "description": "The D3 library focuses on a data-driven approach. When you have a set of data, you can apply D3 methods to display it on the page. Data comes in many formats, but this challenge uses a simple array of numbers.\n\nThe first step is to make D3 aware of the data. The `data()` method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.\n\nA common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the `enter()` method for this purpose.\n\nWhen `enter()` is combined with the `data()` method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.\n\nHere is an example that selects a `ul` element and creates a new list item based on the number of entries in the array:\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <ul></ul>\n  <script>\n    const dataset = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n    d3.select('ul')\n      .selectAll('li')\n      .data(dataset)\n      .enter()\n      .append('li')\n      .text('New item');\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nIt may seem confusing to select elements that don't exist yet. This code is telling D3 to first select the `ul` on the page. Next, select all list items, which returns an empty selection. Then the `data()` method reviews the dataset and runs the following code three times, once for each item in the array. The `enter()` method sees there are no `li` elements on the page, but it needs 3 (one for each piece of data in `dataset`). New `li` elements are appended to the `ul` and have the text `New item`.",
      "instructions": "Select the `body` node, then select all `h2` elements. Have D3 create and append an `h2` tag for each item in the `dataset` array. The text in the `h2` should say `New Title`. Your code should use the `data()` and `enter()` methods.",

      "description": "In the previous challenge, you saw how to get JSON data from the freeCodeCamp Cat Photo API.\n\nNow you'll take a closer look at the returned data to better understand the JSON format. Recall some notation in JavaScript:\n\n<blockquote>[ ] -> Square brackets represent an array.<br>{ } -> Curly brackets represent an object.<br>\" \" -> Double quotes represent a string. They are also used for key names in JSON.</blockquote>\n\nUnderstanding the structure of the data that an API returns is important because it influences how you retrieve the values you need.\n\nOn the right, click the `Get Message` button to load the freeCodeCamp Cat Photo API JSON into the HTML.\n\nThe first and last character you see in the JSON data are square brackets `[ ]`. This means that the returned data is an array. The second character in the JSON data is a curly `{` bracket, which starts an object. Looking closely, you can see that there are three separate objects. The JSON data is an array of three objects, where each object contains information about a cat photo.\n\nYou learned earlier that objects contain \"key-value pairs\" that are separated by commas. In the Cat Photo example, the first object has `\"id\":0` where `id` is a key and `0` is its corresponding value. Similarly, there are keys for `imageLink`, `altText`, and `codeNames`. Each cat photo object has these same keys, but with different values.\n\nAnother interesting \"key-value pair\" in the first object is `\"codeNames\":[\"Juggernaut\",\"Mrs. Wallace\",\"ButterCup\"]`. Here `codeNames` is the key and its value is an array of three strings. It's possible to have arrays of objects as well as a key with an array as a value.\n\nRemember how to access data in arrays and objects. Arrays use bracket notation to access a specific index of an item. Objects use either bracket or dot notation to access the value of a given property. Here's an example that prints the `altText` property of the first cat photo - note that the parsed JSON data in the editor is saved in a variable called `json`:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(json[0].altText);\n```\n\nThe console would display the string `A white cat wearing a green helmet shaped melon on its head.`.",
      "instructions": "For the cat with the `id` of 2, print to the console the second value in the `codeNames` array. You should use bracket and dot notation on the object (which is saved in the variable `json`) to access the value.",

      "description": "Another way to request external data is to use the JavaScript `fetch()` method. It is equivalent to `XMLHttpRequest`, but the syntax is considered easier to understand.\n\nHere is the code for making a GET request to `/json/cats.json`\n\n```js\nfetch('/json/cats.json')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data);\n  });\n```\n\nNote: The `fetch()` method uses `GET` as the default `HTTP` method. This means you don’t need to specify it explicitly for basic data retrieval.\n\nTake a look at each piece of this code.\n\nThe first line is the one that makes the request. So, `fetch(URL)` makes a `GET` request to the URL specified. The method returns a Promise.\n\nAfter a Promise is returned, if the request was successful, the `then` method is executed, which takes the response and converts it to JSON format.\n\nThe `then` method also returns a Promise, which is handled by the next `then` method. The argument in the second `then` is the JSON object you are looking for!\n\nNow, it selects the element that will receive the data by using `document.getElementById()`. Then it modifies the HTML code of the element by inserting a string created from the JSON object returned from the request.",

      "description": "You can also request data from an external source. This is where APIs come into play.\n\nRemember that APIs - or Application Programming Interfaces - are tools that computers use to communicate with one another. You'll learn how to update HTML with the data we get from APIs using a technology called AJAX.\n\nMost web APIs transfer data in a format called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.\n\nJSON syntax looks very similar to JavaScript object literal notation. JSON has object properties and their current values, sandwiched between a `{` and a `}`.\n\nThese properties and their values are often referred to as \"key-value pairs\".\n\nHowever, JSON transmitted by APIs are sent as `bytes`, and your application receives it as a `string`. These can be converted into JavaScript objects, but they are not JavaScript objects by default. The `JSON.parse` method parses the string and constructs the JavaScript object described by it.\n\nYou can request the JSON from freeCodeCamp's Cat Photo API. Here's the code you can put in your click event to do this:\n\n```js\nconst req = new XMLHttpRequest();\nreq.open('GET', '/json/cats.json', true);\nreq.send();\nreq.onload = function () {\n  const json = JSON.parse(req.responseText);\n  document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].innerHTML =\n    JSON.stringify(json);\n};\n```\n\nHere's a review of what each piece is doing. The JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` object has a number of properties and methods that are used to transfer data. First, an instance of the `XMLHttpRequest` object is created and saved in the `req` variable. Next, the `open` method initializes a request - this example is requesting data from an API, therefore is a `GET` request. The second argument for `open` is the URL of the API you are requesting data from. The third argument is a Boolean value where `true` makes it an asynchronous request. The `send` method sends the request. Finally, the `onload` event handler parses the returned data and applies the `JSON.stringify` method to convert the JavaScript object into a string. This string is then inserted as the message text.",

You can also send data to an external resource, as long as that resource supports AJAX requests and you know the URL.\n\nJavaScript's `XMLHttpRequest` method is also used to post data to a server. Here's an example:\n\n```js\nconst xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('POST', url, true);\nxhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=UTF-8');\nxhr.onreadystatechange = function () {\n  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 201) {\n    const serverResponse = JSON.parse(xhr.response);\n    document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].textContent =\n      serverResponse.userName + serverResponse.suffix;\n  }\n};\nconst body = JSON.stringify({ userName: userName, suffix: ' loves cats!' });\nxhr.send(body);\n```\n\nYou've seen several of these methods before. Here the `open` method initializes the request as a `POST` to the given URL of the external resource, and passes `true` as the third parameter - indicating to perform the operation asynchronously.\n\nThe `setRequestHeader` method sets the value of an HTTP request header, which contains information about the sender and the request. It must be called after the `open` method, but before the `send` method. The two parameters are the name of the header and the value to set as the body of that header.\n\nNext, the `onreadystatechange` event listener handles a change in the state of the request. A `readyState` of `4` means the operation is complete, and a `status` of `201` means it was a successful request. Therefore, the document's HTML can be updated.\n\nFinally, the `send` method sends the request with the `body` value. The `body` consists of a `userName` and a `suffix` key.",
